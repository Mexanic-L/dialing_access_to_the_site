# dialing_access_to_the_site
Fell free to use it

This is a super simple script that helped me a little during the age of computer network problems. It simply contacts the URL you specify when you launch it. It does this endlessly with a small interval; if a connection is established, it lights up and informs you about it, but continues trying to call until it is interrupted.

Example of how to run a script:
bash dialing_access_to_the_site.sh https://www.youtube.tv:443
or
bash dialing_access_to_the_site.sh https://www.youtube.tv



(It runs via GIT - so download the application (https://git-scm.com/install/), then run the .git console in the folder with the script and then enter the command specifying the desired URL)
