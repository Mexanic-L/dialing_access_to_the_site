# dialing_access_to_the_site
This is a super simple script that helped me a little during the age of computer network problems. It simply contacts the URL you specify when you launch it.

Example run skript:
bash dialing_access_to_the_site.sh https://www.youtube.tv:443
or
bash dialing_access_to_the_site.sh https://www.youtube.tv
